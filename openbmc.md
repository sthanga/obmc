DBus
	Bus Types:
		system Bus
		Session Bus
		private Bus
		-- alsomost all are runs in system bus only
	
	D-Bus Objects:
		D-bus represents services as object with unique paths
		Ex :/xyz/openbmc_project/State/chassis0
		-- Each object has Method, Properties, signal
	D-Bus Services :
		A Dbus services is a running process that provide objects, Ex:
		xyz.openbmc_project.Logging (Logging Service)
		xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host (Host State Service)
		xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Temperature (Temperature Sensor)
	Use/test case of Dbus implementation
		To List:
			busctl list   -- > it will show all dbus Services
		
		Inspect a Specific Service :
			busctl tree xyz.openbmc_project.State.Chassis    -->This shows the object tree of the Chassis state service.
		
		Get Properties of a D-Bus Object :
			busctl introspect xyz.openbmc_project.State.Chassis /xyz/openbmc_project/State/Chassis0 
			|--->>>>shows methods, properties, and signals.
		
		Get a specific property value :
			busctl get-property xyz.openbmc_project.State.Chassis \
				/xyz/openbmc_project/State/Chassis0 \
				xyz.openbmc_project.State.Chassis \
				CurrentPowerState
		
		Call a D-Bus Method :
			busctl call xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host \
				/xyz/openbmc_project/State/Host0 \
				xyz.openbmc_project.State.Host \
				Transition s "On"
			--- >>>Turn on the system power
		
		Monitor D-Bus Signals :
			busctl monitor
	Steps to Create a D-Bus Service in OpenBMC
		Set up the environment
		Create a new service using C++
		Define a custom D-Bus interface
		Compile and install the service
		Test the D-Bus service
